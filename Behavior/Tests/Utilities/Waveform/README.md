# Waveform

**A simple Python wrapper that provides an abstraction of a time-based signal.**

This simple package includes a `Waveform` class that takes in a series of timestamps and values to provide an abstraction of a time-based signal.

The `Waveform` can later be manipulated or queried to provide data about a specific event or time range.

The package also includes some testing functions that interact with the `Waveform` object and provide assertion capabilities for specification tests.
